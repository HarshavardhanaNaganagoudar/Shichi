# 🌸 Shichi – A Mindful, Local-First Wellness Tracker

**Shichi** is a beautifully minimalist self-care tracker that visualizes your wellness as a 7-petal flower. Each petal represents a vital area of your well-being — and blooms when you meet your daily goals.

Built with privacy in mind, **Shichi runs fully offline** and leverages on-device AI (powered by **Gemma 3n**) to generate reflective daily and weekly wellness summaries — without storing your data in the cloud.
